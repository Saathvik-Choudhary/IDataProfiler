🧭 1. Data Quality Strategy & Governance
Purpose:

Define the policies, ownership, and accountability around data quality.

Core Components:

Data Quality Policy Framework

Define what “data quality” means in your company.

Align with business goals and compliance standards (GDPR, ISO 8000, etc.)

Data Ownership

Data Stewards, Data Owners, Data Custodians

Data Quality Metrics (KPIs)

% completeness, % valid records, % duplicates, % anomalies detected

Data Governance Committee

Cross-functional governance board to oversee data policies.

Metadata Management Integration

Align with enterprise data catalog and lineage systems.

🧩 2. Data Quality Dimensions
Purpose:

Implement measurable quality metrics across standardized dimensions.

Core Dimensions:

Accuracy – Does data reflect reality?

Validation against reference/master data.

Completeness – Are all required fields populated?

Missing value thresholds and alerts.

Consistency – Is data uniform across systems?

Schema drift detection and cross-source comparison.

Uniqueness – Are duplicates eliminated?

Fuzzy matching, deduplication logic.

Validity – Do values conform to allowed patterns/formats?

Regex, range, and domain validation rules.

Timeliness – Is data updated on time?

Late-arrival tracking, freshness metrics.

Integrity – Are relationships preserved (FKs, referential integrity)?

Join consistency and orphan record checks.

Conformity – Are naming, codes, and units standardized?

⚙️ 3. Data Quality Rule Engine & Framework
Purpose:

Create a scalable, configurable engine to define and execute DQ rules.

Components:

Rule Authoring Layer

GUI or YAML/JSON-based rule definition.

Rule Execution Engine

Parallel rule execution using Spark, Flink, or SQL.

Rule Types

Validation Rules, Business Rules, Referential Integrity Rules.

Rule Templates

Predefined patterns for common checks (nulls, duplicates, format).

Rule Management

Versioning, tagging, approval workflows.

🧠 4. Data Quality Monitoring & Observability
Purpose:

Continuous and automated visibility into data quality health.

Capabilities:

Data Profiling

Automated discovery of data patterns, distributions, and anomalies.

Quality Dashboards

Interactive visualizations (Grafana, Superset, Power BI) with scorecards.

Anomaly Detection

ML-based drift and trend detection.

Alerting

Slack, email, or ServiceNow integration for threshold breaches.

Data Lineage Integration

Trace impact of upstream changes on DQ metrics.

🧰 5. Data Cleansing & Remediation
Purpose:

Enable automated and manual correction of data errors.

Key Capabilities:

Data Standardization

Normalize addresses, date formats, casing.

Reference Data Validation

Validate against master or external data (postal, ISO, etc.).

Deduplication & Merging

Fuzzy matching (Soundex, Levenshtein, ML models).

Remediation Workflows

Send data quality issues to responsible teams.

Data Enrichment

Fill missing data via external APIs or master data lookup.

🔒 6. Data Quality Lifecycle & Automation
Purpose:

Integrate DQ checks into the entire data lifecycle — ingestion → transformation → consumption.

Implementation Areas:

Data Ingestion DQ

Validate incoming files, APIs, and streams.

ETL/ELT DQ

Integrate checks in data pipelines (Airflow, dbt, Azure Data Factory, etc.)

Post-Load DQ

Verify data in data warehouse/lake after transformations.

Continuous Quality Monitoring

Schedule daily/real-time jobs.

CI/CD for Data Pipelines

Auto-run DQ checks in build pipelines (similar to unit tests).

🧾 7. Metadata & Lineage Integration
Purpose:

Make quality context-rich, traceable, and auditable.

Integrations:

Data Catalog

Automatically publish DQ metrics next to datasets.

Data Lineage

Upstream/downstream impact analysis.

Schema Change Tracking

Detect and alert on drift or unexpected schema changes.

Audit Logs

Keep full DQ rule execution history for compliance.

📊 8. Reporting & Analytics Layer
Purpose:

Show the overall health of enterprise data in business terms.

Outputs:

Data Quality Scorecards

Dataset-level DQ index (0–100 score).

Trend Analysis

How quality metrics evolve over time.

Business Impact

Correlate DQ issues with KPIs (e.g., lost revenue, compliance risk).

Executive Dashboards

Visual summary for leadership (Data Quality Heatmaps).

🧠 Bonus: Advanced Features to Consider (for Maturity Level 2–3)

AI-Powered Rule Suggestion

Use ML to automatically propose validation rules from profiling.

Data Contract Enforcement

Use schema registry to validate producer/consumer compatibility.

Self-Service DQ Portal

Let data owners define and monitor their own DQ rules.

Quality-as-a-Service

Microservice exposing APIs for rule checks, profiling, etc.

Data Trust Scoring

Assign trust scores to datasets for prioritization.
