🏗️ Enterprise Data Quality Transformation Roadmap (for Shell)

Each phase builds on the previous one, maturing from basic visibility to predictive, automated quality governance.

🌍 Phase 1: Data Profiling, Cleaning & Baseline Establishment

(“Know your data”)

🎯 Objective

Discover, profile, clean, and benchmark current data across critical domains.

🔧 Key Activities

Automated Data Profiling

Scan all critical data sources (SAP, PI, historians, wells data, trading systems, etc.).

Generate completeness, accuracy, conformity, and consistency stats.

Data Cleansing & Standardization

Fix missing, duplicate, and invalid values.

Standardize units, formats (especially for production metrics, well IDs, etc.).

Data Quality Baseline

Compute initial DQ scores per domain (0–100 index).

Create dashboards to visualize baseline quality.

Data Quality Issue Log

Central repository for discovered issues and owners.

Data Steward Onboarding

Assign stewards for top data domains (asset, production, finance, logistics).

🏁 Deliverables

Profiling engine + dashboards

Clean, standardized priority datasets

Initial DQ benchmark and stewardship ownership established

⚙️ Phase 2: Data Quality Rules Engine & Continuous Monitoring

(“Control your data”)

🎯 Objective

Shift from one-time cleaning to continuous, automated data quality control.

🔧 Key Activities

Central DQ Rules Repository

Define rules per domain and dataset.

YAML/JSON or UI-driven authoring with version control.

DQ Execution Engine

Integrate checks into ingestion, ETL/ELT, and streaming pipelines.

Run DQ tests nightly or near-real-time.

DQ Dashboards & Alerts

Visualize rule results in Grafana or Power BI.

Auto-alert data owners on threshold breaches.

Integration with Workflow Tools

Airflow, Azure Data Factory, or AWS Glue orchestrate DQ runs.

DQ Scoring Service

Generate dataset-level quality scores and trend metrics.

🏁 Deliverables

Rule execution framework

DQ scorecards and continuous monitoring pipelines

Automated alerting and integration with operations

🔒 Phase 3: Data Governance, Ownership & Metadata Integration

(“Govern your data”)

🎯 Objective

Institutionalize governance and embed DQ into Shell’s enterprise data landscape.

🔧 Key Activities

Data Ownership Framework

Formal roles: Data Owners, Stewards, Custodians per domain.

DQ Policy & Standards

Define what “good quality” means by data type and business area.

Metadata Management Integration

Connect DQ platform with enterprise catalog (e.g., Azure Purview, Collibra, Alation).

Data Lineage Capture

End-to-end flow visibility from source (SCADA, ERP, etc.) to analytics and dashboards.

Auditability & Compliance

Log every DQ rule execution and remediation for ISO 8000, GDPR, SOX audits.

🏁 Deliverables

DQ policies and RACI matrix

Integrated metadata & lineage view

Full audit trail and compliance documentation

🧰 Phase 4: Data Remediation, Master Data & Reference Data Alignment

(“Fix your data at source”)

🎯 Objective

Move from reactive fixes to proactive prevention via master and reference data management.

🔧 Key Activities

Central Data Remediation Hub

Workflow for DQ issues with approval/escalation (e.g., ServiceNow or custom portal).

Master Data Management (MDM) Integration

Sync key entities: Assets, Wells, Vendors, Customers, Materials.

Reference Data Standardization

Harmonize units, codes, hierarchies (ISO standards, Shell’s internal taxonomies).

Root-Cause Analysis

Identify process or system causes of poor quality.

Data Validation APIs

Validate inputs at data entry points (e.g., production reporting systems).

🏁 Deliverables

Active remediation workflows

Aligned master/reference datasets

Reduced recurring data quality issues

📡 Phase 5: Data Quality Observability & Trust Analytics

(“Measure and trust your data”)

🎯 Objective

Achieve near-real-time visibility into data trustworthiness and business impact.

🔧 Key Activities

Data Observability Layer

Monitor freshness, volume anomalies, schema drift.

Integrate with tools like OpenLineage or Great Expectations.

DQ Metrics Warehouse

Store historical DQ metrics for analytics.

Data Trust Scores

Compute composite “trust index” per dataset.

Impact Analytics

Quantify how poor DQ affects production, trading, or compliance KPIs.

DQ Heatmaps for Leadership

Executive dashboards by domain, region, and system.

🏁 Deliverables

Real-time DQ observability dashboards

Historical DQ metrics warehouse

Executive-level trust analytics and ROI metrics

🧠 Phase 6: Predictive & Autonomous Data Quality

(“Optimize and automate your data quality”)

🎯 Objective

Leverage AI/ML for predictive data quality management and full self-service.

🔧 Key Activities

Machine Learning for Anomaly Detection

Predict missing data patterns, detect sudden drifts or outliers.

AI-Assisted Rule Recommendation

Suggest new DQ rules based on profiling and historical violations.

Self-Service DQ Portal

Allow data owners and analysts to define/monitor DQ rules without IT.

Data Contract Enforcement

Schema registry ensures producers meet quality expectations.

Continuous Improvement Loop

Feedback from business outcomes refines DQ rules automatically.

🏁 Deliverables

ML-driven anomaly detection and rule generation

Self-service portal for stewards and data consumers

Predictive, autonomous data quality management

🚀 End-State Vision (Phase 6+)

Shell achieves:

Enterprise-wide data trust and transparency.

Continuous, real-time DQ visibility across all operations.

Integration of DQ with ESG, predictive maintenance, and AI workloads.

Reduced downtime, optimized asset management, and compliant reporting.
